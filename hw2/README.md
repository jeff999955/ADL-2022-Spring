# ADL HW 2

## Tasks

1. Context Selection
2. Question Answering

## Environment
The required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. 
In addition to packages allowed by TA, I used `wandb` to record the training statistics.

## Information
This pipeline consists of two tasks, context selection and question answering, which could be trained simultaneously.

## Context Selection
### Training      
Recommended:
```shell
accelerate launch multiple_choice.py [OPTIONS]
```

Please use `python3 multiple_choice.py -h` for detailed options.

## Question Answering
### Training 
```shell
accelerate launch question_answering.py [OPTIONS]
```

Please use `python3 question_answering.py -h` for detailed options.

## Note

The `--device` option is deprecated as the package ðŸ¤—  `accelerate` is used to manage devices. To force the accelerator use some device, please pass the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to the process.
